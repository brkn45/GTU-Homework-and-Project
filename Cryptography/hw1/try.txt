APT38 is a cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2014. It is believed to be 
sponsored by the North Korean government and has targeted various organizations and governments 
around the world, including financial institutions, defense contractors, and government agencies. 
APT38 is known for its sophisticated tactics, including the use of custom malware and 
targeted spearphishing campaigns to gain initial access to victim systems. It is also 
known for its use of "living off the land" tactics, in which it uses legitimate 
tools and software to carry out its operations in an attempt to avoid detection. 
APT38 has been linked to several high-profile attacks, including the 2014 attack on 
Sony Pictures and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, 
which affected hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries.
